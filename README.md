### About
An Augmented Reality iOS application developed with Swift to assist new students in navigating their way inside University of Waterloo buildings. Currently supporting Engineering 7 building. With QR codes taped around the walls, students can scan the QR codes and easily find their way to common spots such as washrooms, lift lobbies, and exit doors via 3D spheres developed using ARKit. Each QR code represents a unique JSON which is parsed to obtain the exact address of the user.
